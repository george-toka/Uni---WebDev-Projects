<h2> Online Voting System + back-end/database manipulation </h2>

In the context of my university course "Databases" each team was expected to pick a topic, (or come up with their own) of which
they would create an SQL Database. The flow of the individual tasks was to first create an entity-relationship diagram & its referential integrity diagram. 
Then using PuTTY, implement the Database based on the final structure and familiarise ourselves with the SQL syntax and capabilities.  
Ultimately, we had to implement a website for our topic of choice where we would showcase the functionality of our database by accessing
and editing various attributes. Along with the website we also had to create views, stored procedures, triggers and transactions. <br>
<br>
Our topic of choice was an Online Voting System for Greece. For the implementation of the website we used HTML,CSS and internal/external frameworks
like Grid,Flexbox & Bootstrap. For back-end manipulation we were asked to use PHP. The back-end scripts were basically already given as templates to create
and structure the website around them, but due to our differentiation of our topic from the suggested ones we went on to create our own. <br>
<br>
**Important note: Because the creation of the website and the various functionalities of our database was done at the same time, <br>
these functionalities couldn't be utilised due to lack of time. Nevertheless they are existent and fully functional in the database itself. <br>
